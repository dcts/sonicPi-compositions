# sonicPi-compositions

Some of my compositions made in SonicPi. The repository currently contains 1 composition:
- [test-composition.rb](./test-composition.rb): a composition that uses global parameters to control the sound
- [test-composition-OSC.rb](./test-composition-OSC.rb): same composition than above but with OSC controller (via [TouchOSC app](https://itunes.apple.com/ch/app/touchosc/id288120394?mt=8))



### Instructions
To hear the composition you need to have [SonicPi](https://sonic-pi.net/) installed. Then simply copy & paste the code into an empty buffer and compile the program (shortcut: ALT+r). Have fun exploring!
