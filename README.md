# sonicPi-compositions

Some of my compositions made in SonicPi. The repository currently contains 1 composition:
- [test-composition.rb](./test-composition.rb): a composition that uses global parameters to control the sound


### Instructions
To hear the composition you need to have [SonicPi](https://sonic-pi.net/) installed. Then simply copy & paste the code into an empty buffer and compile the program (shortcut: ALT+r). Have fun exploring!
